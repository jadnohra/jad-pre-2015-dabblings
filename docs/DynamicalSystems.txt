Motor control (except for zero velocity) should not happen within solver

Rb becomes point mass for one frame, masa determined by orient/vel/inert-tensor

----------- 

Research pt: is perturb resp for limit misbehav? What are the ther. Effects. Can we warm up unperturbed with perturbed?

----------- Solver mixing
* Can we not use 'static' forces when mixing solvers (ignore the Painleve paradox, or fix by perturbation?), that is, in one frame (substep), for one run of a direct solver, then one run of the iterative solver, resolve the whole direct solver constraint system affected, and not just the direct body affected, by doing force calculations, that do not need a time intervale (no impulse), warm starting from the direct solver results. 
Can this be a method? using a perturbed direct solver to bypass the painleve paradox.
A search provides the not directly related, but possibly useful for Painleve paradox intuition article:Investigation of Painlev√©'s paradox and dynamic jamming during mechanism sliding motion (http://tx.technion.ac.il/~izi/publications/Painleve_paper_RCD2014.pdf)

My rule when I'm reviewing papers, or teaching students, is that you first have to solve problems whose solution you know. Of course, those will be simpler than the one you want to solve. So, when you solve the more complicated one, you must solve it on at least three meshes, each more dense than the one before, to show that the key results do not change significantly (define significant!) from mesh to mesh. Otherwise you are looking at a combination of solution and error, and don't know which. This is the philosophy I use in my book, Intro.to Chemical Engineering Computing, Wiley, 2012. See www.ChemEComp.com. Of course, if you can compute error bounds you know, but that is usually only possible for simple problems. I treat that, too, at www.ChemEComp.com/MWR.

Parallel mlcp system, except for dyn/dyn contacts (revalc systems iter), and other explicit rules

---------

Make all masses equal, run 1 iter, partition on weak interactions to mlcp systems!!!!???? 
Or similar. Test converg, or run parallel 1-iter-random order, etc?? Find 'easy points'

Since we are gather ctraints! Partition into systems when indep!!!. For the rest, optimize with sparsity?!

ODE: motor+limit uses a hack, but the problem should actually be solvable, is the issue a singularity like the one discussed in: 'A Numerically Robust LCP Solver for Simulating Articulated Rigid Bodies in Contact'?
(Probably the pivot choice is a problem due to almost parallel lines, implement a fix. Also why are the lines not exact parall?)

* Implement valve-control limits (similar to the KMW digger), which are actually more stable numerically.

	- Crucial: positional configurator, stability max per constr, apply pt impulses (contact pert), self contact pert.
	- Some of dis virtual classes should be in dsl scripts.
	- The measure of stability will have to be ad-hok, number + inf mean unstable? Instead of variance use linear approx of local maxima pts.
	- Types of predicted 'stable behavior'
	- add num. Stabil analysis: stable, asympt stable, by doing perturbations!!! Important. (see ITPA)
	- note: bias acts as the small excitations in oscillators!

------- LCP research
* An efficient automatic alt. to perturb/lexi for factorization implementations.
* Symbolico-numerical algo.
* Fix Judice's erratum.
* We know a lot more about possible sources of singularity, we can maybe even remove these sources and/or prioritize them. This will make the algorithms approach iterative robustness.
* Is it possible to create a simple specific cycle trap given our extra knowledge about the system?
* Can perturbation also be used to handle singulariy in syst-of-eq solving? Think of parallel lines that are perturbed.
* Solve limits with cpa, then motors with ppcd2 or some sign (for limits) preserving algo
* 'Warm start' : knowing the basis try to reach that first with min pivots?
* Cant we presolve and solve in parallel??
