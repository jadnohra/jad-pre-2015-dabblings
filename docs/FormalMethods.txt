About Us
GE Global Research – Europe employs approximately 200 engineers and scientists from more than 30 different countries. Our scientists and technologists come from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds, including chemistry, physics, mathematics, engineering, sciences and materials research.
Located in the heart of southern Germany, Global Research – Europe sits on the Garching campus of the Technical University of Munich. This creates a unique blend for our scientists to be in a university setting, while performing research in a world-class industrial lab that is dedicated to bringing new technologies to market. The facility also operates closely with technology teams at GE businesses across the globe, ensuring effective transition of breakthrough innovations from the lab into advanced products and services. Within the R&D community, the center maintains close partnerships with numerous universities, research institutions and technology companies in Germany and abroad.
Current research at the facility focuses on automated manufacturing of composite parts, waste heat recovery for industrial and power applications, grid integration of renewable energies, molecular imaging for cancer diagnostics, high power electronics for stationary and mobile applications and advanced compressor technologies.
