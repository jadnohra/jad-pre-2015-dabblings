* Tic-Tac-Toe AI testbed *
**************************

Introduction
------------

	This code is a tic-tac-toe game implementation, it started out as a 4 hour interview coding test.

	I was learning machine learning when I remembered that I had this lying around,
	so I added Steve Chapel's Alpha-beta minimax, and I implemented a Reinforcement-Learning value iteration version.

	The code has a simple test that allows testing the different AIs against each other, it also has a Random playing AI
	and supports Human vs. AI using console input.

	There is almost no documentation, but the code should be easy to understand. 


Current AIs
-----------

	All in all the code contains 3 different AI implementations all playing perfect Tic-Tac-Toe:
		
	 * Rule based perfect play, this is possible because Tic-Tac-Toe is a 'solved game'
	 * Alpha-beta minimax, using Steve Chapel's code
	 * Reinforcement-Learning value iteration

Building
--------

	Visual Studio 2008 solution and project files are provided, however it should be very easy to make the code
	work with other compilers and on other platforms as it does not use any platform specific features.

	A win32 executable is also provided.

	This is not exactly ground breaking rocket science, so do with the code whatever you like, it would be nice if you let me know...
