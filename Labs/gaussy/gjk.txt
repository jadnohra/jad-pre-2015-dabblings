Convex hull Cvx
Origin O

Choose first point in convex, make it the simplex S.
Complete simplex S
	if S is 0-simplex
		get direction to origin D
		get support vertex for D, V
		add V to S
		Complete simplex S
	if S is 1-simplex
		choose orthog direction to O, P
		get support vertex for P, V
		add V to S
		done
Get closest point on S to O, C
if C is O 
	done, intersecting
else
	reduce S using C
		if C is a vertex in S, reduce to 0-simplex
		reduce to 1-simplex containing C
	goto Complete Simple S
